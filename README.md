# Mission Control

A web app that is designed to present upcoming rocket launches around the world! This application uses an API to collect this information, then processes it to present clean, readable information at a glance. Additionally, this app has a visual globe feature that maps the upcoming launches and any that have very recently been launched. As someone with a fascination of space and space exploration, this was an engaging project to build that can help keep me informed of the exploration advancements!

## Why I Built This

Space has always been a very interesting area for me and has always been an engaging concept for me. Being that rocket launches are usually our primary method of interacting with and exploring space, I wanted to build something that myself and others can use to view some of the upcoming rocket launches. This way, users will know where to look for the next expansions into space and can view in-person or through provided livestreams the rocket launches.
